            <h3>FitRing</h3>
            <p>FitRing is a design proposal for a ring-shaped wearable made for runners. It tracks important running
                data and communicates through vibrations and audio, making it easy to stay focused while running.
                <br><br>
                It’s designed for runners who run regularly and like listening to music or podcasts while tracking their
                performance.

            <h3>Music App</h3>
            <p>My team and I worked on a post-punk music app. The wireframes were designed in Figma.
                <br><br>
                Post-punk is a genre known for its melancholic atmosphere, which often combines dark and emotional
                tones. We aimed to create an app to reflect this mood.
                <br><br>
                The app is made for anyone who enjoys post-punk music and wants a space dedicated to discovering and
                listening to it.

            <h3>Co-Lab Board</h3>
            <p>Co-Lab Board Game is a project created for Malmö City Library, Sweden. It was designed as a tool that
                librarians can use to develop, manage, and make decisions about the library’s open and shared spaces.
                <br><br>
                The game includes a playing board and persona-based game pieces. It supports user-centred, participatory
                design approach.

            <h3>Interactivity</h3>
            <p>In this project, I explored different types of interactivity, including keyboard inputs, Arduino-based
                inputs, and hand gestures.
                <br><br>
                The goal was to see how these different input methods change the overall experience and what new
                possibilities they open up. The focus was also on how closely a digital experience can start to feel
                like experience from real life.
                The app is made for anyone who enjoys post-punk music and wants a space dedicated to discovering and
                listening to it.
